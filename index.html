            <h2>Postmodern Criminology: The Violence of the Language</h2>

            <p>Starting from the 1990s, postmodern criminology has been gaining substantial importance. This discipline lays particular emphasis on such aspects as gender, class, and race in its theories of the origins of crime. According to Arrigo (2019), postmodern criminology recognizes the specific value of language as a non-neutral, politically charged instrument of communication. Linguistic elements serve to represent the views and the values of a particular social group.
            Such a notion as the violence of language suggests that words may carry damaging meaning, being an oppression tool in the modern environment. Arrigo (2019) states that the courtroom discourse is often offensive to some participants of the process, representing the phenomenon of linguistic oppression, referring to the Los Angeles riots resulting from such a situation. Postmodern criminology aims at investigating such negative tendencies and providing potential solutions. Women appear to be one of the groups, which have been experiencing the system’s oppression in current settings. Arrigo (2019) writes that most criminology education activities are conducted by white males representing the middle class. Accordingly, women who pursue criminology have their professors’ and supervisors’ views imposed on them. This hegemony is expressed through particular linguistic patterns, which reveal their discriminatory nature after thorough analysis.

            <h2>Variola Virus Prevention and Infection Control</h2>
            <p>As a technologist, I must learn the nature of different pathogens, even those that do not bother people today. This knowledge helps me predict the development of dangerous diseases and recognize symptoms fast. Many microorganisms like bacteria, fungi, viruses, and protozoa provoke mutations and diseases (Jensen & Peppers, 2006). Some pathogens are thoroughly investigated, and some organisms are forgotten and neglected. The World Health Organization declared the eradication of smallpox at the end of the 20th century, which reduced the need for vaccination but increased the threat of its accidental release (Melamed, Israely, & Paran, 2018). Still, this disease is characterized by severe symptoms like fever and a rash, and new forms of vaccination may be required soon.
            Smallpox is usually caused by the variola virus that contains large DNA genomes. This pathogen belongs to the family Proxviridae, the subfamily Chordopoxvirinae, and the genus Orthopoxvirus (Melamed et al., 2018). During face-to-face or physical contact, the variola virus is transmitted from an infectious individual via salvia airborne droplets into the nasal or oral membranes. The virus affects the respiratory tract along with infection of the mouth or lung mucosa. As this pathogen causes smallpox in humans only, pathogenesis research remains limited.

            <h2>Analysis of Drug Classification</h2>
            <p>Radiologic technologists play an important role in providing patients with care and assessment. These medical specialists are responsible for conducting imaging procedures to examine people’s physical and emotional well-being and promote diagnostic accuracy (Suchsland et al., 2020). In clinical settings, radiologists should identify and prescribe different pharmacological agents during the examination. Drug reactions depend considerably on patients and administration methods, and the chosen group of employees must know the basics of drug classification and understand the potential impact of medications on patient care.
            For example, many diabetic patients require intravenous contrast-enhanced exams like computed tomography or angiography. People who take metformin to decrease the glucose level in their blood may experience a deterioration of renal function and lactic acidosis (Hsu et al., 2018). Radiologists’ awareness of drug classification allows understanding the importance of additional tests to check the creatinine level and the glomerular filtration rate and see how the kidney works. This information is necessary because it shows if it is better to stop taking metformin at the time of the exam to obtain correct results. When a radiologic technician knows the classification of drugs, it is possible to analyze the patient’s condition and predict the development of adverse effects.

            <h2>Company vs. Government Budgeting Processes</h2>
            <p>The budgeting processes of a company and a government have several differences. Governmental budgeting is less flexible compared to business; it requires allocating resources regarding various federal agencies. Authorities adopt top-down budgeting considering fiscal stress (Hendrick, 1989). A top-down approach means that the government implements the budgeting process with minimal involvement of lower-level departments (Hendrick, 1989). This approach makes it possible to fully consider the goals, reduce the time spent, and avoid the problems associated with the coordination and aggregation of individual budgets.
            All official entities require formal budgeting; the process consists of submitting the budget request, assessing the appropriateness of sums, and issuing the budget documents, becoming legally binding. Therefore, the budgeting processes of a company it is not required by law. Moreover, large enterprises use incremental budgeting; the budgets for this model are based on the actual results of the last year, the expected growth in indicators, and inflation next year (Hendrick, 1989). Furthermore, companies adopt bottom-up budgeting, a more democratic method, when operational personnel is involved in the budgeting process (Tan & Low, 2017). The heads of departments draw up their budgets and agree on critical indicators, after which the budgets are combined into one financial plan.
